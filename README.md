NOTE TO GRADER:  

The primary issue from before was the assignment of the DOM element of the variable currentHeader resulting in an erroneous passing of the final test.  This issue has been fixed!  Now, failing to load a new item into the feed will result in a failure of the final spec!

How to use these tests:

1)  Examine the logic in feedreader.js
2)  Open index.html in your web browser
3)  Observe the tests results at the bottom of the page.

Extra info:

*Testing framework is Jasmine-2.1.2
*jQuery is referenced in index.html
